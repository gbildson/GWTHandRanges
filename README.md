## What is GWTHandRanges?
GWTHandRanges is a basic texas holdem poker hand evaluator for when two or more players are playing a hand.  The table state can be progressively defined.  See the link above for a visual demonstration.

Structurally, this code is a google web toolkit wrapper around some of my poker code and poker evaluation services.
